# Ways of the Mentor 

Launched in February
2013 by Mulga Gidgee, **Mentoring workshops** have now been held in Darwin and Arnhem Land
NT, with participants from CDP, childcare facilities, government departments, Indigenous organisations, councils and schools. 

**One-on-one employment and cross cultural mentoring **services are also enabling Indigenous and Non-Indigenous staff to work better with one another.

## Mentor Training

> "...Scott, I thought I would take the opportunity to once again say how
> refreshing it was to get new perspective on working within communities with the
> locals. Your presentation let those of us who are in direct mentoring positions
> reassess our approaches and provided alternative techniques to try..."

The workshop combines brief lectures with
structured interactions to allow participants to practice and refine specific
mentoring skills. The workshop includes the opportunity to identify mentoring
strengths and weaknesses, interact with other mentors, and develop specific,
core competencies for effective mentoring.

To have **Ways of the Mentor** at your
organisation, or to attend an upcoming workshop, please email scott@mulgagidgee.com.au 

Mulga Gidgee also happily hosts the [NT
Employment Mentors Network][0]
