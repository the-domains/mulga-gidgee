# Community Engagement

Mulga Gidgee has worked across Australia
with many different Indigenous Communities from urban, rural and remote areas.

Prior to establishing Mulga Gidgee, Scott
& Annie McCall worked in Maningrida where a framework called the "**Five
Rights**" was developed by board & staff members of the, then, Maningrida JET
Centre during a Community governance training program. 

Mulga Gidgee continues to use and promote
this framework which ensures they have the **RIGHT people, language, place, time & way** of doing things in Community.

**Community Engagement projects have
included:**

- PaCE (Parents & Community Engagement) Minjilang Community 

-PaCE Amangal Community, Adelaide River 

- PaCE Kormilda College 

- PaCE x2, Maningrida 

- Marngarr Resource Centre, Gunyangara
