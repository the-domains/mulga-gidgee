Mulga Gidgee has worked across Australia
with many different Indigenous Communities from urban, rural and remote areas.

Prior to establishing Mulga Gidgee, Scott
& Annie McCall worked in Maningrida where a framework called the "Five
Rights" was developed by board & staff members of the, then, Maningrida JET
Centre during a Community governance training program. 

Mulga Gidgee continues to use and promote
this framework;

## The Five Rights -- A Framework for Community
Engagement: 

**1\. Right People**

Finding the right people to assist us with
our work is the most important of the 5 Rights. Aboriginal communities and
families can be socially and culturally complex. Developing a picture of
significant Community members that relate to your specific project and should
be involved is a good place to start. At a community level, you may need to
liaise with local agencies such as the school or health clinic. Be aware that
there is a high turnover of non-Indigenous staff in these organisations and in
many cases a local Aboriginal person (Teacher Assistant or Aboriginal Health
Worker) may have better long--term knowledge to assist you.

**2\. Right Time **

When organising community contacts, or
visits, it is crucial to ensure that you align with family and broader
community priorities. Funerals, ceremonies, employment and other community
business can often take priority. 

**3\. Right Place **

There are a few key considerations to
ensuring right place. Is the location suitable for the attendees? Is the
relationship between them and the host venue manager OK? How will people get
there? Do you need to facilitate transport? Are there toilets and tea/coffee
facilities? Are you bringing catering or buying local? How will you get from
the airport? Do you have a backup plan for communications if your transport is
delayed? Will the host agency and/or Community agents require payment for their
assistance?

**4\. Right Language **

Clear communication is critical to
effective community engagement. What is the main language of the group you are
meeting with? Do you need an interpreter? With ESL clients it is sometimes
better to use visual or graphic based presentations and handouts that are
written in plain language. Be aware that in any group there is likely to be
varying degrees of comprehension. In many remote communities the incidence of
hearing loss and visual impairment is more common. Allowing space in our
communication for other participants to re-tell or translate our information is
an important part of being understood.

As a general rule, when communicating with
ESL clients speak clearly and check whenever possible that the message has been
understood.

**5\. Right Way**

Let Aboriginal people inform all aspects of
"how" it should happen. When all this comes together --- That is RIGHT WAY ---
When not sure about any of the rights go to number 1 --- Find the Right PEOPLE
and ask them.
