Cultural competence has many definitions
and refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different
cultures. 

One definition says:

_"...Cultural competence comprises four components: _

_(a)
Awareness of one's own cultural worldview, _

_(b) Attitude towards cultural differences, _

_(c) Knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and _

_(d) Cross-cultural skills. _

_Developing cultural competence results in
an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with
people across cultures..."_\*

Using these core frameworks and Hoefstede's
Cultural Dimensions Theory, Scott seeks to take participants on a
self-reflective journey into their own, workplace, international and Indigenous
cultural frameworks. Workshops are tailored for each client and can run from 4
