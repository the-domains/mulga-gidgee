Cultural competence has many definitions
and refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different
cultures. One definition says "...Cultural competence comprises four components: 

(a)
Awareness of one's own cultural worldview, 

(b) Attitude towards cultural differences, 

(c) Knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and 

(d) Cross-cultural skills. 

Developing cultural competence results in
an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with
people across cultures..."\*
