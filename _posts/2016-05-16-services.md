**Mentoring**

Ways of the Mentor was launched in February 2013 by Mulga Gidgee. Workshops have now been held across Darwin and Arnhem Land NT, with participants from CDP, childcare facilities, government departments, Indigenous organisations, councils and schools. 

One-on-one employment, organisational and cross-cultural mentoring services are also enabling Indigenous and Non-Indigenous staff to work better with one another.

The workshop combines brief lectures with structured interactions to allow participants to practice and refine specific mentoring skills. The workshop includes the opportunity to identify mentoring strengths and weaknesses, interact with other mentors, and develop specific, core competencies for effective mentoring.
