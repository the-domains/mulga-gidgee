**Scott McCall**

Scott has worked in the Indigenous
employment and training sector for over 20 years. In that time he has held
positions in urban, regional and remote areas throughout NSW, Qld and the NT in
government, non-government and corporate environments. Before establishing
Mulga Gidgee Scott was with Qantas managing their Indigenous programs amongst
other diversity initiatives; prior to that he was the CEO of an Indigenous RTO
based in Arnhem Land NT.

Scott has an excellent track record of
innovation and success in Indigenous community development, education and
employment. Scott's out-of-the-box-approach has yielded results in the most
hostile of environments. Scott seeks to work at the cultural interface,
dynamically facilitating positive outcomes for all stakeholders.

**Annie McCall**

worked mainly in the non-government sector with Indigenous, justice, training,
consumer and environmental organisations throughout urban and remote
Australia.

Annie has degrees in Law and
Applied Science (Coastal Management), a Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice and
is admitted to the Supreme Court of NSW. Annie is a director of the YWCA of
Darwin Inc and the Museums and Art Galleries of the NT Foundation Ltd. Most
recently Annie was awarded a scholarship to complete the Australian Institute

on the Status of Women.

The amazing Chrissy manages Mulga Gidgee's
Sydney operations. Chrissy is a skilled personal development trainer, mentor,
event coordinator and tango dancer.

**Local People, Local Knowledge**

Mulga Gidgee could not work where we do
without our extensive network of local Indigenous Community Agents. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b759d8977a80f07f96e46ab2c0e06b26457d012f.jpg)
