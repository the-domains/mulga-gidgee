## IT'S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS

& what matters... 

**Individuals Matter**- Listen! Everyone has a
story to inspire and the capacity to positively impact

**An Open Heart Matters**- Judgement is for
judges

**Congruency Matters**- Talking and walking

_**Why Mulga Gidgee?**_

_The Mulga and Gidgee trees are members of
the Acacia / wattle family. They are both trees that thrive in challenging
environments and provide nutrients and protection that allow a more diverse eco
system to flourish under their influence. _

_The Mulga is the faster growing of the two
and provides in botanical terms a relatively quick fix before maturing and
recycling its goodness for the benefits of the other plants that have come
behind it. _

_The Gidgee tree whilst fulfilling a similar
role is there for the long haul and may grow for many hundreds of years; the
slow growing nature of the tree produces one of the hardest and most durable
timbers found in Australia. These two trees represent the fundamental
philosophy of the company which is that of Organic Sustainable Australian
solutions for the short and long term._
